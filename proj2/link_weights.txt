1. link latencies
An interactive teleconferencing session may want to have the packets sent with links of the lowest latencies possible.

2. miss rate
On-line banking may want to have the packets sent with links of the lowest miss rate possible. Therefore, when there is a transaction, the important information won't get lost and cause the update to be wrong.

So we have three metrics, the lowest hop count, the lowest link latencies and the lowest miss rate.
                              L1
                      miss rate: 20%, link latency:15 msecs
                         h1---------r1
                          | \        |      
                          |  \       |               
                          |   \ L5   |
          L4              |    \     | L2
    link latency:40 msecs |     \    |miss rate: 30%  
    miss rate: 5%         |      \   |link latency: 20 msecs     
                          |       \  |        
                          |        \ |          
                         r2---------h2
                             miss rate: 5%
                             link latency:25 msecs
                               L3

    The link directly connecting h1 and h2 have miss rate equal to 99% and link latency equal to 99 msecs. 
     
    So according to the lowest hop count, h1 should send packet to h2 through L5;according to the lowest miss rate, h1 should send packet to h2 through L4 and L3;according to the lowest link latency,h1 should send packet to h2 through L1 and L2.
